# Universe API
Java Spring Boot API to manage celestial objects. Planets, stars, galaxies and many others. 

## Help contribute.
We need more endpoints for this API. Can you help me develop them?
It is just simple CRUD operations for:
* Galaxies
* Stars
* Comets
* Moons

Just be aware of celestial relationships. for example: Galaxies can contain **many** planets but **a planet** can be only in **one single galaxy.**
